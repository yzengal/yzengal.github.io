In the following, I collect some interesting real-world datasets in spatial databases.

## Road Networks
These real-world road networks were extracted from **OpenStreetMap** on Feb. 2021, based on the processing method in our VLDB'18 paper.
If you want to use the road networks below, please consider citing this homepage and our VLDB'18 paper whose bibtex is listed below:
